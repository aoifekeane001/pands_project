### Project Name 
Fisher Iris data set analysis

### Project Description
Purpose of this project is to research the Fishers Iris data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it, demonstrating learnings from ATU Programming & Scripting course modules 

### Project Scope
#### In Scope
Data: 
* Fishers Iris data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) 

Project Requirements: 
* Python Program
* Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file 
* Saves a histogram of each variable to png file 
* Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables 
* Performs any other appropriate analysis 

#### ouut of Scope
Data: 
* Any other data set not listed in scope of this document

Project Requirements: 
* Any requirement not listed in scope of this document

### Project Objectives
- Research the Fishers Iris data set online and write a summary about it in your README
- Download the data set and add it to your repository
- Write a program called analysis.py that:
-- Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file 
-- Saves a histogram of each variable to png file 
-- Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables 
-- Performs any other appropriate analysis 

### Assumptions
* Correct data set used for the project
* Measuring system is accurate and precise

### Approach 
Process
* Data Collection 
* Data Preparation 
* Data Exploration 
* Data Visualation 
* Results Interpretation

Use of Python:
* NumPy: supports n-dimensional arrays and provides numerical computing tools - useful for Linear algebra and Fourier transform
* Pandas: to handle missing data, manipulate the data, perform mathematical operations
* Matplotlib: to add data visualisation (e.g. graphs, charts, histograms, plots)

### Initial Data Research & Summary
* Fisher's Iris data set was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936
* Data set was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository
* It is a well-known and commonly used data set in the field of machine learning & statistics and pattern recognition techniques
* The data set consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples of each of the three Iris species
* The data set consists of measurements of four features of the three different species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica 
* It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower
* One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other
* The four features / variables measured for each sample are - Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
* Key objective of the Fisher's Iris data set is to distinguish between the three different species of irish flowers based on the measurement features

Program Analysis & Summary
Analysis Program in Python 
* Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
* Saves a histogram of each variable to png file 
* Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables 
* Performs any other appropriate analysis
