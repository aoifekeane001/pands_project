### Project Name 
Fisher Iris data set analysis

### Project Description
Purpose of this project is to research the Fishers Iris data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it, demonstrating learnings from ATU Programming & Scripting course modules 

### Project Scope
In Scope
* Data: Fishers Iris data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris) 
* Analysis: Using Python - date exploration & interpretation using NumPy, Pandas & data visualisation using Matplotlib

Out of Scope
* Data: Any other data set not listed in this document
* Analysis: Any other analysis not listed in this document


### Project Objectives
- Research the Fishers Iris data set online and write a summary about it in your README
- Download the data set and add it to your repository
- Write a program called analysis.py that:
-- Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file 
-- Saves a histogram of each variable to png file 
-- Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables 
-- Performs any other appropriate analysis 

### Assumptions
* Correct data set used for the project
* Measuring system is accurate and precise

### Approach & Solution
Process
* Data Collection: Import the data set, Load the data set
* Data Preparation: Clean the data remove unwanted and redundant values, converting it into the right format, and making it ready for analysis
* Data Exploration: 
* Data Visualation: 
* Results Interpretation

Use of Python:
* NumPy: supports n-dimensional arrays and provides numerical computing tools - useful for Linear algebra and Fourier transform
* Pandas: to handle missing data, manipulate the data, perform mathematical operations
* Matplotlib: to add data visualisation (e.g. graphs, charts, histograms, plots)

### Initial Data Research & Summary
* Data set was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository
* Data set is used to classify iris plants into three species
* It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower
* One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other

### Program Analysis & Summary
Details to be added
* Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file
* Saves a histogram of each variable to png file 
* Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables 
* Performs any other appropriate analysis
